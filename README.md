# Codsoft Internship Project

Welcome to my Codsoft internship project repository, where I have worked on four distinct tasks:

1. Movie Genre Prediction
2. SMS Spam Detection
3. Credit Card Fraud Detection
4. Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview

This repository contains code and resources for the four tasks completed during the Codsoft internship. Each task involves data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and, in some cases, deployment.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Movie Genre Prediction
- Utilized Kaggle dataset for movie genre prediction.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Trained machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, XGBoost, and SVM.

### 2. SMS Spam Detection
- Employed Kaggle dataset for SMS spam detection.
- Conducted EDA to understand the data distribution.
- Trained models using various algorithms to predict SMS spam.

### 3. Credit Card Fraud Detection
- Utilized Kaggle dataset for credit card fraud detection.
- Implemented EDA for data understanding and preprocessing.
- Trained models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- Developed a Streamlit web app for credit card fraud detection and attempted deployment on an Amazon EC2 instance.

### 4. Customer Churn Prediction
- Applied EDA to understand customer churn data.
- Trained machine learning models to predict customer churn.
- Analyzed the factors influencing customer churn.


## Running the Code

To run any specific task, follow the instructions in the respective notebooks or scripts. Make sure to install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Streamlit Apps

For tasks involving Streamlit apps (credit card fraud detection), navigate to the `streamlit_apps` directory. Run the apps using the following command:

        ```bash
       streamlit run credit_card_app/app.py

## Deployment (Credit Card Streamlit App)
- The Streamlit app for credit card fraud detection is deployed on an Amazon EC2 instance.
- Access the app by visiting App Link.
  
## Conclusion

This internship provided valuable experience in data exploration, preprocessing, and model development for various tasks. The deployment of the credit card fraud detection app showcased practical applications of machine learning in real-world scenarios.

Feel free to explore the notebooks and scripts for each task and reach out for any clarifications or discussions.
